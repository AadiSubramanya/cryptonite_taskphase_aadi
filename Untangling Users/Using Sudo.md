# Using Sudo
## Code:
```bash
hacker@users~using-sudo:~$ sudo cat /flag
pwn.college{kKY9eGSbnknWq1S1BpRzZbqZjLe.dhTN0UDLycjN0czW}
```
## Learnings:
- Modern Linux systems favor `sudo` over `su` for admin tasks, as `sudo` runs specific commands as root based on permissions.
- I used `sudo` to read the flag, highlighting its convenience for privilege elevation.
