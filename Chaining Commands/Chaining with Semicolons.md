# Chaining with Semicolons
## Code:
```bash
hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$ /challenge/pwn; /challenge/college
Yes! You chained /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{YVLsKcXtyLPkmKp8Vte_gRZX1NV.dVTN4QDLycjN0czW}
```
## Learnings:
- You can chain commands in the shell using a semicolon (;), allowing multiple commands to run sequentially.
- For example, echo COLLEGE > pwn; cat pwn executes both commands in one line.
