# Setting Variables
## Code:
```bash
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{Y53b-W3CzLsK-CSl3TmPzx5SfXa.dlTN1QDLycjN0czW}
```
## Learnings:
- Learnt how to assign values to variables in the shell using VAR=value without spaces around the =.
- I also understood that I use $ only when I want to access the variable's value. For this challenge, I need to set the variable PWN to COLLEGE.
