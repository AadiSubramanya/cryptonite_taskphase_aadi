# Multi-word Variables
## Code:
```bash
hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$ PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{cS-vNPOo4iN4fzRpqwSF0OhfLk9.dBjN1QDLycjN0czW}
```
## Learnings:
- Learnt about quoting in the shell to handle spaces in variable assignments.
- Spaces are significant, so when I want to set a variable like `VAR` to a value that includes spaces, I need to use quotes so it considers it as one token.
