# Starting Backgrounded Processes
## Code:
```bash
hacker@processes~starting-backgrounded-processes:~$ /challenge/run &
Here is your flag!
pwn.college{wh_jfITRCIyCdheD3JE7IrsSj34.dlDN4QDLycjN0czW}
```
## Learnings:
- Starting a process in the background by appending `&` to the command.
- This allows it to run without taking over the terminal.
- For this challenge, I need to launch `/challenge/run` in the background to get the flag.
