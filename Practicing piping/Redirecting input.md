# Redirecting input
## Code:
```bash
hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$ echo COLLEGE > PWN
hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$ /challenge/run < PWN
Reading from standard input...
Correct! You have redirected the PWN file into my standard input, and I read
the value 'COLLEGE' out of it!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{EPpNByoEE7bGQw99Gvfl4YcXaa0.dBzN1QDLycjN0czW}
```
